For this project, we will be working to improve the email filtering system for an ISP's customers. We have beenn provided with a dataset that contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. The ISP wants us to take this dataset and develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.

In order to meet the ISP's requirements, we will be creating two classification models to fit the provided data i.e a logistic regression model and a random forest model. We will then evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam.
